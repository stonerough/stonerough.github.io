Hi

The vendor has advised that they corrected the "base" record for this title and I have used their data to effect correction to the record we are using in our discovery. 

The record is at  https://waikato.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/64WAIKATO_INST/e9d0ae/alma9917885424703401

Thank you for bringing this to our attention so we could implement a fix, not only for ourselves, but for the wider user community

Thanks

Hi Cecilly

Thank you for confirming you can now access the sites.

I encourage you to use the Eduroam network when on campus. The Eduroam network is accessible to all University staff and students and does not require University hardware. Once configured, it can be used on many university campuses worldwide. For those on campus, the Library strongly recommends using the Eduroam network. Instructions for connecting to Eduroam can be found here.

We do not recommend or have confidence in the use of any other wireless networks on campus, including "waikato" when accessing our online resources.

Thanks

Hi Roy and Cecily

Thank you for those screenshots. The URLs do tell me a couple of things. 

I suspect that Cecily was not getting past clicking on the link on whatever page she was on. 

Cecily, It would be good to confirm where it was/is you where attempting to perform the access from.

Thanks

Hi Fumiko

Sorry this request had a delay. I experienced a problem I had never encountered before when attempting to load these file into the library digital archive for my home network. It took me a little while to work out how to get around this!

I have added the three YouTube clips to the Japanese news collection at https://waikato.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/64WAIKATO_INST/10hutka/alma9917737181403401 They should be the first three in the list.

I am hoping the quality is okay. They had to be downloaded at a reduced quality than I am happy with.

Morning Tintu,

I understand from John's email that you are experiencing problems accessing our online resources. We indeed had very real problems for a lot of off campus users in the last few days. Hopefully most of those problems are now behind us! 

It is not clear in the email John forwarded, what actual online book(s) is causing you a problem. In general I ask users to do the following...

The first thing to attempt is to eliminate your browser being the cause: 
  • Try using another browser and/or try "incognito" mode with your normal browser. 
  • If either of the previous work (and even if they do not), try clearing your normal browser cache history. Generally you do this in Settings under Privacy and Security and look to "Clear browsing data" and Cookies 

The next thing to consider is the network situation of the equipment you are using: 
  • Normally this is not a problem from a home network and should not be a problem from a University wired LAN. BUT if you are using a business/corporate network, or are you working from a network in a cafe, sometimes these networks will not allow access to our proxy server due to the way the network is set up. 
   • At the university, if you are using a wireless network, check that you are connecting via the Eduroam network. Using any of the others can be a problem. 

If you are still not getting to the resource, please send screenshots of the page that you see and include the URL and I will see what I can do for you.

Thanks

Hi Amy

I just "love" that not all departments at Clarivate/Proquest/Ex Libris use the case management system... In this case it is "ProQuest Ebook content"

Looks like my request about the title "Building on Our Strenghts : Improving Education in Aotearoa New Zealand" (case  07762568) is going to be sorted...

The email below came into my personal inbox overnight

Cheers     Peter

Hi Cathy

I have been investigating the remainder of that problem with the BWB collections and the display in discovery of the title "An Indigenous Ocean Pacific Essays" from that original reading list query. 

There is still a problem with that title display I have not managed to resolve. (If you do a search in discovery, you will see the problem!)

In the course of my investigation, I noticed that the Marc record supplied for "An Indigenous Ocean Pacific Essays" from BWB had "artifacts" from another Marc record - Pretty sure this is the result of their record creation where, an original record for another title was used to begin a Marc record for a this title - fields from the original title were not eliminated. In this case there were author/contributors in the record that definitely were NOT correct. I have removed those fields. I think possible that this record creation methodology is contributing to this problem.

During my testing, I stumbled across other discovery searches that produce a problematic dual link in the discovery record. If you search for "Te Pouhere Kōrero. Volume 8" and or "Te Pouhere Kōrero. Volume 2" you will see what I mean. The worrying thing is I think it likely this is occurring with other records in these collections.

I am sorry that I have to ask for your input here, but I have hit the limit for what I am prepared to keep hammering at...

I am hoping you can provide me with a steer on how I might proceed to clean this up....

Thanks    Peter

Hi Chloe,

I confirm that I want to retain my car park (209).

I have examined my last payslip for the Period End 14-JUL-2024

I notice that in the "Deduction" section of the payslip, the first line is itemising Parking. 

Here is a snip of that section/line:



I have NOT taken any action to stop this parking deduction from it's inception. 

Unless you advise otherwise, I am assuming I need to do NOTHING further.

Hi there

We have been advised by the University IT division that they need to change the backend technology used to perform the SSO authentication for the University of Waikato to vendor sites (Emerald).

Although I have not been able to get SSO working on my account for Emerald, our documentation indicates SSO/federated access has been set up for Emerald since May 2022 
 
To accomplish this type of request, some vendor sites have a web admin page that can be used to change the various settings. Does Emerald have such a facility and if so how to we gain access?
 
Alternatively, we request that a case be opened to assist us in completing this exercise. 
 
I am happy for the moment to be the point of contact although I will be inserting an IT engineer who will perform the work at the University, into the case in due course.

Thanks
